2. Create a folder named ".github" in the root of the repository
3. Create a folder named "workflows" inside the ".github" folder.
5. Create a .yml file with any name , inside the "workflow" folder and you need to code as following example in that yml file

### `workspace`

**Required** Complete path to Eclipse workspace.

### `project`

**Required** The name of the project containing the test.	

### `suite`

**Required** Specify the relative path from the project to the test including the file name of the test. A test can be WebUI test, Compound test, Performance schedule or Accelerated Functional Test (AFT) suite. The test suite name must contain the file extension when it is an AFT suite. To run multiple tests from the same project sequentially, you must separate the tests by a colon (:). If you provide multiple tests, you cannot include an AFT suite along with it.

### `imshared`

Complete path to HCLIMShared location, if it is not at default location.

### `configfile`

**Required** The complete path to a file that contains the parameters for a test or schedule run, If Config file is specified then no other fields will be required.

### `swapdatasets`

Use this option to replace dataset values during a test or schedule run. You must ensure that both original and new datasets are in the same workspace and have the same column names. You must also include the path to the dataset. For example, /project_name/ds_path/ds_filename.csv:/project_name/ds_path/new_ds_filename.csv

### `duration`

Optional. You can use this argument to specify the duration of the stages in the Rate Schedule

### `exportlog`

Optional. You can use this parameter to specify the file directory path to store the exported HTTP test log. You can provide multiple parameter entries when running multiple tests. You must use a colon to separate the parameter entries. For example: c:/logexport.txt:c:/secondlogexport.txt

### `exportstats`

https://github.com/github/docs/issues/15710

Specify the below inputs in the Key=Value format.
Ex: publish=publish_URL_val|usercomments=Value2

## Multiplevalue inputs
